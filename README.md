**Hachiko** is a data collection library that tries to continue what Immutable.js started.
By offering a similar API, a smaller focus and micro optimizations, this project is trying
to be a good alternative.

It's persistent like Immutable.js, more performant, and offers the most commonly used
data collections, namely: Map, List, OrderedMap, Set, and OrderedSet.

## Benchmarks (up to date with `master`)

Benchmarks indicated that Hachiko's Map implementation beat Immutable's in almost all benchmarks that were thrown at it that
are commonly used to benchmarks HAMT implementations:

## Status

Only the `Map` data structure was ever implemented and work has stopped one year ago (December 2016)

- [x] Map
- [ ] List
- [ ] OrderedMap
- [ ] Set
- [ ] OrderedSet
